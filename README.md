## Project
I made a password generator that takes user inputs with number, uppercase, lowercase, and symbols. Also required the user pick the length of the password between 8 and 128. I made it so if the user didnâ€™t select any number, uppercase, lowercase, and symbols it would send a alert message with info they needed to get a password to generate.

#### Notes

I really tried to use char codes like the youtube video but i ran into a lot of complications. When i got it to work I was basically coping the youtube videos code and so i used an array with each charter and number.
